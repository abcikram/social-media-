## const user = await userModel.findById(userIdByParam);
        
## const { password, updatedAt, ...other } = user._doc;

* const { password, updatedAt, ...other } = user._doc;: Once the user document is retrieved, the code uses object **destructuring to extract specific properties from the user._doc object**. The properties being extracted are password and updatedAt. The rest of the properties are gathered into the other object.

* By excluding the password and updatedAt properties from the extracted object, the code likely intends to omit sensitive information (such as the password) and the timestamp of the last update. This can be useful for security and privacy reasons when sending data to the client or performing other operations where these properties are not necessary.

* It's important to note that the code assumes that the user object exists and has an _doc property that holds the actual user document retrieved from the database. If these assumptions are not met, an error might occur. Additionally, the code snippet doesn't show what happens with the extracted properties (password, updatedAt, and other), so there might be further logic or operations involving these variables not shown in the provided code snippet.
